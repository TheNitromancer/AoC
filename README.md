My attempts at the different puzzles of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
Everything here has been coded (as of yet) in visual studio. Coming from Code::Blocks I find the project structure of VS really annoying for small, sepparate bits of code like theese, but I don't know of any alternatives so, oh well.
